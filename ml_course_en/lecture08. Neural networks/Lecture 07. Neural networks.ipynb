    "# Non-Linear Classification Problem\n",
    "When we want to use machine learning to build a car image classifier, we need a training dataset with true labels, a car or not a car. After learning process, we get a good classifier. When we test it with a new image, the classifier will answer whether this new image is a car or not.\n",
    "![](../../img/lec07_01.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Before moving on, we need to know how a computer ‘sees’ a picture. Like the picture in the right, a computer always ‘sees’ an image as a bunch of pixels with intensity values. For example, the picture shows the position of a pixel (red point) and its intensity value is 69.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](../../img/lec07_02.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let’s see the learning process. First, take two pixels as features.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](../../img/lec07_03.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, define a **non-linear logistic regression** as a hypothesis ***H***. Our goal is to find a good ***H*** which can distinguish positive data and negative data well.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](../../img/lec07_04.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Last, learn all parameters of ***H***. Compare this with linear logistic regression, the non-linear form is more complex since it is with lots of polynomial terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, when a number of feature is large, the above solution is not a good choice to learn complex non-linear hypothesis. Suppose we have a 50x50 pixels image and all pixels are features, hence, a non-linear hypothesis must have more than 2500 features since ***H*** has extra quadratic or the cubic features. The computation cost would be very expensive in order to find all parameters $\\theta$ (or $W$ as previously) of these features per the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, we need a better way — Neural Network, which is a very powerful and widely used model to learn a complex non-linear hypothesis for many applications.\n",
