    "## General Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "Before performing the practical work, you need download the data set accordingly to the option on your machine\n",
    "1. Write a program that splits the original sample into a training set and a test set (training set, validation set, test set)\n",
    "2. Using the scikit-learn library (http://scikit-learn.org/stable/), train the linear regression model (or any other model) for the training sample (example: http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/linear_model/plot_ols.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-linear-model-plot-ols-py)\n",
    "3. Check the accuracy of the model from the test sample\n",
    "4. Build a model using a polynomial function (example: http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/model_selection/plot_underfitting_overfitting.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-model-selection-plot-underfitting-overfitting-py). Build plots with the dependence of the error on the degree of the polynomial function.\n",
    "5. Build a model using regularization (example: http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/linear_model.html). On the basis of experiments, select parameters for regularization.\n",
    "6. Build a model using Perceptron (http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.Perceptron.html) and MLPClassifier (http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.neural_network.MLPClassifier.html). On the basis of experiments, select values for learning rate, the regularization parameter, the optimization function.\n",
    "7. Build learning curves for better explanation of your experiments.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Options\n",
    "Data sets are taken from the UCI Machine Learning Repository\n",
    "https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/\n",
